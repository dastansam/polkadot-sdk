title: "`try-runtime`: Add `StateDiffGuard` to record state difference and guard against unexpected storage changes"

doc:
  - audience: Runtime Dev
    description: |
      This PR adds a `StateDiffGuard` helper struct that records the state difference between 
      its initialization and drop. It can be used to guard against unexpected storage changes 
      and also for recording the state difference for testing, debugging, and other purposes.

      Example:
      ```rust
      let _guard = StateDiffGuardBuilder::default()
        .must_change(StoragePrefix{
          pallet_name: b"Balances",
          storage_name: b"TotalIssuance",
        })
        .build();

      // do something that may change the storage

      // the guard will panic if the storage is changed unexpectedly at the end of the scope
      ```
